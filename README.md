### Introduction
Our brief was to create a full-stack web app with a RESTful API. The API was to be made with an Express app and a MongoDB database and it was to be consumed by a React front end.

Our app is a website that enables users to register, log in and post details of music events for users of the website to see.



The front end also pulls in information about venues and events from external APIs for user of the website to see.


## Process
_Describe the process of building the game. How did you get started? How did you manage your time? How would you do things next time?_

Working in a team of three presented the possibility of merge conflicts. Work was allocated is a way to avoid code conflicts, as far as possible, on merge and each developer worked on feature branches which we merged in to development. The GitHub repository owner pushed clean code from development, to master and then to Heroku.

After deciding on the idea, wireframes were created to ascertain the functionality we wanted the front end React app to have and therefore what data schema the database was to have

The Express App and database was the first thing to be created to enable event and user info to be stored.

Once this API was in place, and all routes tested, the building of the React app could begin to consume our API, and other external APIs.
