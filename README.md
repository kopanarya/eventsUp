### Introduction
Our brief was to create a full-stack web app with a RESTful API. The API was to be made with an Express app and a MongoDB database and it was to be consumed by a React front end.

Our app is a website that enables users to register, log in and post details of music events for users of the website to see.

The front end also pulls in information about venues and events from external APIs for user of the website to see.
